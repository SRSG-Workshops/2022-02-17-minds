## Project Managment Setup ##

Before we get started, there are a few requirements to meet. You will need:

* [A GitHub account](https://github.com), with ssh key access.
* A GitHub repository titled `climate-analysis` (created in our **Version Control with git** training).
* A code editor (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

If you haven't done our **Version Control with git** training and don't have a `climate-analysis` repository, you can create an empty one now. 
No specific contents are required for this lesson.
